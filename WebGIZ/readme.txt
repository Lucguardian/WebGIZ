This demo application expects two shapefile datasets in the App_Data folder,
which are not included.

Either place two sets of shapefiles "Rivers.*" and "Countries.*" in the
App_Data folder which contains the countries and rivers of the world, or change
the InitializeMap method in Default.aspx.cs to point to other shapefile data.
